## Problem Description:
The task at hand is to model and build a reltional database for the general workings of a resort company. The central entity in the model is the Hotel entity of the resort- Hotel being each physical inn the company owns and operates in various locations. The hotel is operated in conjunction with the activities, dining establishments, transportation service, etc. that it offers to the guests who book with them. We are interested in accurately modeling these relationships, generating sample data, and populating the entities and their attributes with this sample data. Furthermore, we are interested in performing functioning queries on this data so that they may provide us with valuable business insight about the resort and its operations.

## Data Model
An explanation of the data model including the relationships between the entities in natural English.

## Ten Queries:
1. Include a natural language description of the query 
2. A justification as to why each query is relevant from a managerial perspective (why would a manager be interested in the query results).
3. Screenshots of the query and responses
4. Break down of features covered in each query in matrix form

Avoid having queries that are almost identical to one another. You may include screenshots of the
query as well as the response of each query. You can also use the code markdown to highlight the
SQL code and copy and paste the results into the file.

To ensure the complexity of the queries some of the things that may be considered include
multiple table join, subquery, correlated subquery, GROUP BY, GROUP BY with HAVING,
multi condition WHERE, Built-in functions (e.g., AVG) or a calculated field, REGEXP, NOT
EXISTS, and more.

You may combine some of the preceding list of features into a single query (still have to provide
10 queries). Indicate in matrix format in your report which features are covered in a query. A
sample matrix is shown

## Database information:
1. The name of the database on the MySQL server. 
2. Bookmarked queries using stored procedures under Module 7

Each table should be populated with enough
data so that the queries return a sufficient result set. All queries should be bookmarked through
the use of stored procedures (take a look at the example under Module 7) according to this
format: TP_Qx (where x is to be replaced by the query number).
Query 1 Query 2 ..........
mul-ple table join x
subquery x x
...
